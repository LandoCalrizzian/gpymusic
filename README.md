Important things that need doing:
- Enable queue restore from shuffle
- Maintain mpv volume across calls (apparently this is pretty much impossible)
- Rewrite the README when all these are done

Less important things to maybe do:
- Seek backwards function
- Text-only UI option (would be really nice for debugging non-curses related stuff)
- Save + restore playlists
- Add threading support (play in background and keep browsing)
- Caching 'now playing' contents for seamless transitions (save locally and delete after? Probably needs threading)
